summary: you should bring a Mac
status: draft

*This is my weekly diary of my experience at [Zipfian Academy](http://zipfianacademy.com/), a one of a kind data science bootcamp. I will have an ultimate review on programming bootcamps once my job search is complete.*

It felt good to finally be busy again after a period of inactivity. It was finally time for 12 hours a day of coding and learning topics that barely register at Universities. After our meet and greet, we installed [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) in our machines in order to use a well-stocked virtual environment with all the compatibilities. A couple of non-Mac people experienced some trouble setting up the virtual environment, so note for people who are interested in the program -- you should bring a Mac.

The day generally goes like this: 

* **0830~0930** | Tightening previous day's work
* **0930~1030** | Code review and lecture on concepts 
* **1030~1300** | Cooode
* **1300~1430** | Nominally lunch, realistically cooode
* **1430~1530** | Code review and lecture for the code sprint
* **1530~1800** | Code sprint so cooode
* **1800~????** | Usually two more hours of fixing stuff or doing extra material

The work is fairly hard and there is a lot of stuff to learn, but it never feels like it's too much. Coding along with other smart people caged in one room is stimulating and it never gets boring. Instructors and mentors are always available to help us focus in the right direction. [Jon](https://twitter.com/clearspandex) is especially gifted at explaining concepts from general principles and makes absolutely sure that we do not become slaves to the tools. 

## Self-teaching is O(n^2)

The first week was focused on processing text with common UNIX tools, getting used to the Git flow and building an Amazon recommender in Python. I could say more, but I'd like to focus on Python for now.

As an R person, I always wanted to learn Python. I've heard a lot of good things from leaner memory management to faster routines and even its [data.frame capabilities](http://pandas.pydata.org/index.html). But I just never got along to it, as R's vast library and my familiarity with the language prevented me from jumping ship. I actually forced myself to learn Python about a month ago just because it seemed like a de facto language of data scientists (I only recently became interested in data science). 

Maybe I'm lazy or maybe I'm slow, but in **two days** I learned more at Zipfian than I self-taught in a month. I now know data types (sets, dicts, etc.), classes (self, scoping, etc.), modules (BeautifulSoup, NumPy), functional programming (map(), reduce(), list comps, etc.), IPython notebooks, unit tests, debugging, file I/O, etc. Yes, I do not have deep knowledge behind the algorithms and the models as someone who has years of experience, but I already have a strong enough base to know where to look if I don't know something. 

We'll delve deeper into Python and some time for personal projects. Once I learn [pymc](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), I might just become a convert to [Python for data analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do). 


<!-- there are certainly people that are behind, one is way ahead so he's just doing a personal project: living in sf lots of activities, more networking and events than i though: zipfian first 5 weeks, fundamentals teaching while coding, 2.5% chance of going in, 13 peeps, univ vs  accelerated learning -->
