summary: San Francisco *is* Silicon Valley

Much of this week was occupied by [DataWeek](http://dataweek.co/). There wasn't much instruction except for the machine learning workshop on Monday. It was supposed to be a mini-bootcamp that the Zipfian fellows and conference attendees would participate in union. But technical problems ensued (we were not going to install [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) and a 150MB dataset to run a few [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) models on a paltry WiFi connection in a room of 80 nerds), so it morphed into a long lecture. 

Which reminds me, I have been kind of discouraged by [Ipython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) as a teaching tool. You basically have to install a whole new Python distribution (Anaconda or [Enthought](https://www.enthought.com/)) to make things work. For lectures it's great because it shows the results of small snippets of code immediately (```%pylab inline``` is a must). For interactive sessions, Notebooks quickly get overwhelmed with output or large amounts of data that it gets very crashy and lethargic. It's so much quicker to test out code in the terminal. It doesn't help that for the life of me I can't install [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) into my Snow Leopard so my only option for plotting is through [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) + Notebooks (doubly crashy). [rpy2](http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2.html) doesn't seem to be working for me either. Exporting the Python code from Notebooks is inconsistent as indent errors abound. ```ipython nbconvert``` does alleviate some of my concerns, but I'm forced to use Notebooks for many tasks.

Tuesday was catch up day for half of the cohort. People that were ahead started on their blogs, I started a mini data science project that I am hoping to finish soon. We roamed around Fort Mason on Wednesday and Thursday to attend talks at DataWeek. The talks broke down as follows: 3 parts data engineering, 3 parts how to leverage big data for business, 3 parts data APIs and 1 part science (at best). I was most interested in the science so the talks left me wanting. The overall vibe that I got was that San Francisco is *the* epicenter for data entrepreneurship. 

Friday was more like a programming bootcamp. A whirlwind tour through MongoDB and [Wikipedia APi](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page). Next week we'll start the machine learning deep dive (yay!).
