Here is a list of data science bootcamps. I've only listed programs where they fully prepare you for a well-rounded understanding of data science. It should include collaborative programming, mentorship by experienced professionals, work on independent projects and possibly networking with employers. For supplementary education, you can go check out [Data Science Central](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/group/data-science-apprenticeship), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci), [Big Data University](http://www.bigdatauniversity.com/),  [Cloudera University](http://university.cloudera.com/), [IBM](http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/41733.wss), [the EMC series](https://education.emc.com/guest/campaign/data_science.aspx), [graduate programs](http://whatsthebigdata.com/2012/08/09/graduate-programs-in-big-data-and-data-science/), etc.

If you're interested in more of the traditional (read: software engineer) bootcamps, you could see [this Quora thread](http://www.quora.com/Computer-Programming/What-are-the-best-programming-bootcamps-courses-available-in-the-United-States) or [BootCamper](http://bootcamper.io).

Please let me know if there are others.

[General Assembly - Data Science](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science) (San Francisco, CA)

I don't know much about this program but they They are more web dev focused but they now have a data science course. 

[Data Science Retreat](http://datascienceretreat.com/)

Looks to be very similar to Zipfian except in Germany!
