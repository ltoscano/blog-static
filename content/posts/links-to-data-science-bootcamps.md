Here is a list of data science bootcamps. I've only listed programs where they fully prepare you for a well-rounded understanding of data science. It should include collaborative programming, mentorship by experienced professionals, work on independent projects and possibly networking with employers. For supplementary education, you can go check out [EventBrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/directory/?q=data+science&loc=San+Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa+Clara%2C+CA&slat=37.39&slng=-121.96&spellcheck=1), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci), [Big Data University](http://www.bigdatauniversity.com/),  [Cloudera University](http://university.cloudera.com/), [IBM](http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/41733.wss), [the EMC series](https://education.emc.com/guest/campaign/data_science.aspx), [graduate programs](http://whatsthebigdata.com/2012/08/09/graduate-programs-in-big-data-and-data-science/), etc.

If you're interested in more of the traditional (read: software engineer) bootcamps, you could see [this Quora thread](http://www.quora.com/Computer-Programming/What-are-the-best-programming-bootcamps-courses-available-in-the-United-States) or [BootCamper](http://bootcamper.io).

Please let me know if there are others.
